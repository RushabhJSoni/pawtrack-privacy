        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last Updated: December 19, 2025</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>🔒 Privacy First</h3>
            <p><strong>Paw Track respects your privacy.</strong> All your pet data stays on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We don't collect, transmit, store, or share any of your information with third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>None.</strong> Paw Track does not collect any personal information, usage data, or analytics from you or your device.</p>
        
        <h3>What You Create in the App:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pet profiles (name, breed, birthdate, photo)</li>
            <li>Activity logs (feeding, bathroom activities, walks)</li>
            <li>Health records (vet visits, vaccinations, medications)</li>
            <li>Reminders and notifications</li>
            <li>Photos and documents you attach</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>All this data is stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account.</strong> We never see, access, or store any of this information on our servers because we don't have any servers.</p>

        <h2>2. How Your Data is Stored</h2>
        
        <h3>Local Storage:</h3>
        <p>Your pet data is stored directly on your iPhone using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to sync with family members.</p>
        
        <h3>iCloud Sync (Optional):</h3>
        <p>If you enable family sharing, your pet data syncs to your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit. This allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access your data across your own devices</li>
            <li>Share specific pets with family members</li>
            <li>Keep your data backed up automatically</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your iCloud data is encrypted and protected by Apple. We cannot access your iCloud data. Apple's privacy policy governs how iCloud data is handled: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">apple.com/legal/privacy</a></p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>We don't share your data with anyone.</strong> Ever.</p>
        
        <h3>Family Sharing:</h3>
        <p>When you choose to share a pet with family members through our family sharing feature, the shared pet's data is transmitted directly between your devices via iCloud. This is peer-to-peer sharing through Apple's infrastructure. We are not involved in this process.</p>
        
        <h3>Export Feature:</h3>
        <p>When you use our PawPack export feature, a JSON file is created on your device that you can share with whomever you choose (such as your veterinarian or AI chatbot). This is entirely under your control.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>We don't use any third-party services.</strong> Paw Track does not integrate with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analytics services</li>
            <li>Advertising networks</li>
            <li>Crash reporting tools</li>
            <li>Social media platforms</li>
            <li>Any other third-party services</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The only external service used is Apple's iCloud, which is optional and controlled by you.</p>

        <h2>5. Permissions We Request</h2>
        <p>Paw Track requests the following iOS permissions:</p>
        
        <h3>📷 Camera Access:</h3>
        <p>Used to take photos of your pets and capture documents (like vet records). Photos are stored locally on your device only.</p>
        
        <h3>📅 Calendar Access:</h3>
        <p>Used to add vaccination due dates to your calendar as reminders. You control which vaccinations get added.</p>
        
        <h3>🔔 Notifications:</h3>
        <p>Used to send you reminders for pet care tasks (feeding, medications, vet appointments). All notifications are generated locally on your device.</p>
        
        <p><strong>All permissions are optional.</strong> You can use Paw Track without granting these permissions, though some features may be limited.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Paw Track does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is designed to be family-friendly and safe for all ages.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>You are in complete control of your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delete individual items:</strong> Swipe to delete any pet, log, reminder, or record</li>
            <li><strong>Delete a pet:</strong> All associated data (logs, reminders, vet visits) is also deleted</li>
            <li><strong>Delete the app:</strong> All local data is removed from your device</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud data:</strong> Deleting the app and disabling iCloud sync will remove data from iCloud</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We don't retain any data because we never had access to it in the first place.</p>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>Your data security is ensured by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device encryption:</strong> All local data is protected by your device's built-in encryption</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud encryption:</strong> iCloud data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
            <li><strong>No remote access:</strong> We cannot access your data remotely</li>
            <li><strong>No user accounts:</strong> No passwords to leak or accounts to hack</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Paw Track offers a one-time purchase to unlock all features ($19.99). This transaction is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store any payment information. Apple's terms and privacy policy apply: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html" target="_blank">apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes</a></p>

        <h2>10. International Users</h2>
        <p>Paw Track is available worldwide. All data is stored on your device or in your personal iCloud account, which may be in a data center in your region. We don't transfer or process data internationally because we don't have access to your data.</p>

        <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is accessible within the app</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Use the PawPack export feature to get a copy of your data</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete any or all data at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You can disable iCloud sync at any time in iOS Settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
            <li>Posting an in-app notification (for significant changes)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Your continued use of Paw Track after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>13. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>If you're a California resident, you have additional rights under CCPA. However, since we don't collect, sell, or share any personal information, these rights are already fully protected by our privacy-first approach.</p>

        <h2>14. GDPR Compliance (EU Users)</h2>
        <p>For users in the European Union:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Controller:</strong> You are the controller of your own data</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Your consent (by using the app)</li>
            <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> All processing happens locally on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Data Transfer:</strong> No data is transferred outside your control</li>
            <li><strong>Right to be Forgotten:</strong> Delete the app to remove all data</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>✨ Our Commitment</h3>
